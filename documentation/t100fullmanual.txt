GENERAL
This Index covers the basic version of the Teleprinter 100 with answerback unit
from Serial No. 2S 37673 onwards, operating on neutral current and in accordance with the International Telegraph Code No. 2.
INSTALLATION SERVICING
Before placing the machine in service it must be carefully re-oiled as
described in Index XII.
2.1. External circuits of the teleprinter
2.1.1.
2.1.2.
Test circuit
Check the printer in a test circuit as shown in Fig. 231 or with the aid of Connecting Unit 9 T bk 13а.
Telegraph current source
A DC voltage of 60 v to 120 v is normally required for operation.
The machine has been designed for a telegraph current of 40 ma. The current is
adjusted in the telegraph office when the machine is connected to the Telex
network. Where a local telegraph current source is employed (e. g. test circuit,
point-to-point circuit), adjust with the aid of a variable resistor (3 kilohms, up
to 5 w).
2.1.3. Wiring of telegraph socket
The most common wiring arrangements are shown in Figs. 232 and 233.
2.2.
2.3.
Internal circuits of the teleprinter
The basic version of Teleprinter 100 is equipped with a 220 v AC commutator
motor connecting to a 220 v AC/40...60 cps power network.
The speed of the commutator motors is kept constant by a centrifugal contact
governor which is adjusted for 3750 rpm.
Commutator motors for other voltages or synchronous motors can be installed
upon special request.
To protect their windings, the AC motors are provided with a thermo-contact
inswitch. This switch interrupts the motor circuit when the motor becomes excessively hot and closes the circuit again when the motor has cooled down.
The coil of the selector magnet has been rated for 75 ohms and for an
ductance of about 1 Henry. It is connected in series with an additional inductance coil of about 125 ohms (inductance about 2.5 Henry).
The machine is provided with a high-grade RF suppressor. RF suppression is
better than grade "K" of VDE C375 Specifications (VDE = Assaciation of German
Electrical Engineers), e. g., at 10 mc: 24 v; in die VHF range of from 30-300 mc:
40 u v/m.
Connection
Insert telegraph plug 1/1 into the telegraph socket. Adjust for a line current of
40 ma. This adjustment is performed in the telegraph exchange when your
machine is connected to the public Telex network.
Before connecting the equipment to commercial power compare the data on
the name plate located on the base plate with those of the commercial power
network to make sure that voltage and type of current are the same. If so,
insert power plug 2/1 into the grounded safety socket.
Note:
The commutator motor of the teleprinter is fitted with automatic disconnect type
carbon brushes. If the motor stops despite un-interrupted power supply (power
socket live), the carbon brushes might be worn to a point where they automatically switch off the motor (see para. 4.6.).

Installing the type basket carriage 48/2
Removal and replacement of the type basket carriage is easiest on the
complete machine, with the motor running and line current flowing through the
selector magnet.
Replacement: Press figures shift key "1...". Push all code bars which are accessible from the right-hand side of the keyboard into their extreme left-hand
position. Momentarily press the first key (counted from the left) in the special
function key assembly (run-out key). Hook one end of carriage return spring
592/2 to eccentric pin 101 and the other to the spring suspension plate of the
type basket carriage. Force the pusher to the rear in the direction of the ribbon
lifter, applying pressure to rollers 106. Install the type basket carriage in such a
way that its rollers "s" and ball bearings 78 glide onto bail 99 and roller 104
comes to rest against rail 105. When installing the carriage, rollers 106 glide
along printer bail 107. Guide pin 108 engages guide bar 109, and the U-shaped
ends of the five bellcranks 110 grasp the bent upper edges of the five transfer
bars 111.
Engage brake lever 97 in broke cylinder of shock absorber 98, press pin 96 upwards through the bore in the brake lever and engage lock 95 from above in the
recess in pin 96. Press letters shift key "A...". Detach the front eye of carriage
return spring 592 from eccentriy pin 101 and engage it in spring suspension plate
112. Then thread the ink ribbon through ribbon lifter 539 as shown in Fig. 5.
Removal: Press letters shift key "A...". Disengage the ink ribbon from ribbon
lifter 539/2. Bring the type basket carriage into the beginning-of-line position by
depressing lever of parallel guide 16a/4. Detach carriage return spring 592/2
from spring suspension plate 112 and hook it to eccentric pin 101 of type basket
carriage 48. Depress figures shift key "1...". Switch off the motor. Turn lock 95
somewhat in a clockwise sense and remove it from the recess in pin 96. Depress
pin 96 and disengage brake lever 97 from the brake cylinder of shock absorber 98.
Depress lever of parallel guide 16a/4 and remove type basket carriage 48 from
the printer towards the left.
Inserting the paper (Fig. 3)
Slide the paper roll onto paper roll axle 3/3 so that pin "b" is on the left-hand
side (seen from the front). The paper roll must rest against this pin "b" and the
paper must feed out to the rear. The anular extension "a" of the paper roll axle
must engage in the groove of the left-hand-paper roll carrier 5 of the metal
cover or of the floor-type cabinet. (The annular extension "a" must engage in
the front groove when installing paper rolls with a diameter of 120 mm, and in
the rear groove in the case of paper rolls having a diameter of 170 mm.)

slot In the case of the metal cover, open the lid and insert the paper in the
between the lid and the cover. Now swing the two levers 6/3 over paper roll
axle 3. Fold the beginning of the paper so as to abtain a sharp crease (this is
to ensure that the paper will be fed uniformly round platen 7/3,4 when knob 8/4
is turned). The paper is guided around tube 671/3 so that the pull on the paper
is equalized. Then the paper underneath rod 593/3 of paper saddle 510. Swing
the two levers 4/4 and 9 upwards before the paper emerges from under the
platen to the front. Continue to turn the platen knob. In doing so, the paper
passes in front of tear-off plate 11. Restore the two levers 4 and 9 which will
hold the paper against the platen.
In order to align the paper, swing lever 10 to the rear. Do not forget to restore
this lever, since paper feed will otherwise be prevented. Now tear the paper off
along the upper edge of tear-off plate 11. Swing lid of metal cover of floor-type
cabinet downwards. In the case of line feed, the paper now automatically
passes out through the slot in the lid of the metal cover or the floor-type cabinet
and can be torn off along glass plate 12/3.
Use teleprinter paper corresponding to the German Standard DIN 6720, Sheet 1,
standard. Please write for address of suppliers if paper of equivalent properties cannot be obtained from local sources.
The printing impact has been factory-adjusted for operation with single-ply
paper. I can be increased for multi-copy working by loosening screw 13/4 and
turning lever "k" of impact adjuster 314 (see also adjustment A189).
Installing the ink ribbon (Fig. 5)
Attach the beginning of the ink ribbon to an empty spool. Slide both ribbon
spools "c" onto the drivers of spool carrier 227 and insert the ribbon in the
ribbon lifter 539. Then run it around rollers "d", "e", "f". "g" and "i" and
thread the ribbon through ribbon guides "h".
Secure the ribbon spools by retaining plates 632 on the right and the left side
of the drivers of spool carrier 227.
Line spacing (Fig. 6)
Depress lever 36 and engage the pin of pull bar 37 in one of the notches
marked
1 x for single line spacing
1.5 x for 1'/2 line spacing
2 x for double line spacing.
Moving the type basket carriage 48/4
The type basket carriage can be released by depressing lever of parallel guide.
It is pulled towards the left by its carriage return spring.
-8-
2.4.7. Range finder (Fig. 7)
Under normal line conditions pointer 525/7 can be set to graduation mark 60 of
range finder scale 32, and adjusting plate 33 can be so positioned that its
lowest mark is approximately level with the mark on the receiver frame (minimum tension of armature spring).
the To adapt the selector mechanism to existing line and circuit conditions,
distant station must be requested to transmit characters R and Y in alternate
succession. After loosening screw 34, turn pointer 525, with the Teleprinter
printing, to either side until a wrong character is printed. In the event of poor
line conditions it may be necessary to repeat this adjusting process with different armature spring tensions (by lowering adjusting plate 35 from graduation
mark to graduation mark). Then fix plate 33 in that position which affords the
widest receive margin.
Set pointer 525 to the center position of the receive margin thereby determined,
e. g. to 65, if the range was found to lie between 40 and 90. This adjustment
of the receiver will serve its purpose only in point-to-point circuits, i. e. where
the receiver of the machine remains connected to the same line. If the machine
is connected to the public Telex network, this adjustment must be performed
in co-operation with the telegraph office.
2.4.8. Coding the answerback drum
If the answerback drum has not yet been coded, proceed as follows:
2.4.8.1. Removing answerback drum 327/7
Depress lever "¡" and pull the drum off the transmitter.
2.4.8.2. Code combs 326/8 of answerback drun 327
The combs installed in answerback drum 327 (viewed in direction A, Fig. 8) are
counted from pin m/8 of the answerback drum in a counter-clockwise sense (see
Fig. 9).
The teeth of each comb [the 2.5 mm wide nose (Fig. 10) must point to the left]
are counted from left to right, i. e. from 1 to 5 according to the five code elements of the 5-unit Telegraph Code No. 2 (Fig. 11).
To obtain the desired character, remove those teeth representing a current pulse
() in the telegraph code table (Fig. 11). The teeth can be removed with the
combs inserted in the drum. Fig.10 shows a comb prepared for character "S", i.e.
00O.
Principally, the first three combs must be coded as follows:
Comb 1: carriage return (<) 00O
Comb 2: line feed
Comb 3: letters shift (A...) figures shift (1...),
2.4.8.3.
2.4.8.4.
or
depending on the first character of the text.
The remaining 15 code combs are available for composing the station identification code. Be sure to remove the teeth of the combs which are not used
for the identification code.
The first and the last signal automatically transmitted is always the letters shift
combination (A...) because, in the rest position, no comb is in engagement
with the code levers of the transmitter.
Fig. 9 shows, as an example, the arrangement of the code combs for the identification code "Siemens Berlin". If the station identification code is composed
both of letters and figures, make sure that no code comb for letters shift is
interposed between the code comb for symbols/figures shift and the following
symbols or figures.
Replacing individual code combs 326/8
If individual code combs have to be replaced for some reason or other, remove
retainer plate 540. The code combs can be taken out individually after removing
washer 561 from their noses.
When installing the new code combs, be sure to insert them in such a way that
their 2.5 mm wide nocses are on that side of the answerback drum on which pin
(m) is provided.
Press washer 561 over the noses of the code combs and replace retainer plate
540. For coding the combs, proceed as described in para. 2.4.8.2.
Installing the answerback drum 327/8
Slide the front of the answerback drum onto the answerback drum shaft of the
transmitter and turn it until pin "m" engages the slot of the answerback drum
drive. The answerback drum is latched in this position by lever "!".

OPERATION
Before placing the reperforator attachment in service for the first time, reoil
carefully the points indicated in para. "Maintenance" (Index XII).
Inserting the paper tape
Prior to inserting a new tape roll make sure that the reperforator attachment is
in the rest position. Remove the chads from chad collector 2201/3 and pull core
2304 upwards and out of tape magazine 2202 as far as it will go.
Place the new tape roll on core 2304 so that the tape feeds out from the underside of the roll and can be inserted in tape guide 2203. Thus the tape roll moves
counterclockwise. Now press the tape roll with the core into the magazine as
far as the lower stop. Thread the tape over cushioning plate "O", through tape
guide 2203, and after depression of pushbutton 2286 ("L"), below roller "p" and
push it further along until it emerges from the arrow-shaped exit 2206.

A1 Position of reperforator attachment on teleprinter mounting base
Set the printer code bars 38, 563 to 566/20 of the teleprinter for code combination 29 (five current pulses), i. e. move the printer code bars to the right.
Turn reperforator camshaft 2270 so that transfer levers 2245 to 2249 are in their
lowest position.
The reperforator must rest against the two pins "a" on the mounting base of
transfer levers 2245 to 2249 and the extensions of code bars 38, 563 to 566
the teleprinter and on the previously adjusted stop 2208. The gap between
must be ≥0.5 mm, while turning camshaft 2270, or the transfer levers must rest
on the printer code bars with their full width.
Adjustment: Loosen the three fillister head screws 500 on the reperforator
as well as the two screws 34 on stop 2208. Shift the reperforator until the
above specified value has been obtained. Tighten the three screws 500.
Move stop 2208 up against reperforator and screw it down by means of
two screws 34.
A2 to A4 Drive of camshaft 2270/20
A2 When transfer shaft 2211 rests against camshaft 17 of the printer, there should
be a gap of approx. 0.3 mm between clutch sleeve 2317 of camshaft 2270 and
sleeve 2212 of transfer shaft 2211.
Adjustment: Loosen fillister head screw 35 and displace sleeve 2212. Tighten
fillister head screw 35.
(A3) When camshaft 2270/20 is turned, lever 2237/30 (ON) causes latching pawl
"s"/20 to engage in sleeve 2212. Latching pawl "s" must engage so far into
sleeve 2212 as its end support in clutch sleeve 2317 allows.
(A4)
A5, A6
Operation of lever 2229/30 (OFF) causes bail 2277/20 to come within reach of
bail 2278 whose extension abuts against bail 2277 when camshaft 2270 is
turned. At the same time latching pawl "s" is forced out of sleeve 2212. In the
rest position (observe adjustment A16), there should be a gap of ≥0.2 mm
between latching pawl "s" and sleeve 2212.
Transfer levers 2245 to 2249/21
(Set printer code bars 38, 563 to 566 for code combination No. 32 (5 no-current
periods), i. e. all printer code bars shifted to the left).
(A5) The gaps between the individual transfer levers 2245 to 2249/21 and the printer
code bars 38, 563 to 566 should be >0.1 mm.
(A6) With the reperforator in its rest position (see adjustment A16), the gap left
between the face of a transfer lever 2245 to 2249/21 and the next following
printer code bar 38, 563 to 566 must be ≥0.2 mm.
A7 to A10 Transfer levers 2236/296, 297, 298
(A7)
(A8)
Switch on reperforator attachment and rotate teleprinter set for code combination 29 (5 current pulses) by hand (all five transfer levers 2245 to 2249/21
are allowed to drop) until feed pawl g/22, 23 has reached its lowest position.
The tip of feed pawl g/22 must now rest on the bottom of a tooth of ratchet
with sleeve 2297. Now, there should be a visible gap "x" between the pin
of feed pawl "g" and lever with sleeve 2234. If not, check adjustmentt of bait
209 (see Index II).
Set the transfer bars of the printer or its code bars 38, 563 to 566/21 for code
combination "Who-are-you" (ОО0) and turn teleprinter by hand. There
should be a gap of ≥0.1 mm between bail 209/23 of the printer and transfer
lever 2236. Lever with sleeve 2234 should rest against pin "k" so that a gap
≥1.5 mm remains between pawl "g" and ratchet with sleeve 2297. If not,
check bail 209 for adjustment values stated in Index II.

(A9) Switch on reperforator attachment, set code bars of teleprinter for code combination No. 29 (5 current pulses) and turn teleprinter by hand until feed pawl
g/24 has reached its topmost position. Backspacing pawl 2279 rests on brake
disc 2280. Slowly depress backspacing lever 2241. This should cause feed
pawl "g" to momentarily disengage from ratchet with sleeve 2297 so that
the latter can be returned by one tooth.
Feed pawl "g" must have again dropped before the backspacing movement
has been completed as it is now to act as a limit stop. There should be a gap
of ≥0.3 mm between backspacing lever 2241 and lever with sleeve 2234.
(A10) Depress lever 2241/24. Rotate teleprinter by hand. Backspacing pawl 2279
should be forced out of engagement with ratchet with sleeve 2297 without

2.1.
2.2.
2.2.1.
2.2.2.
Prior to placing the machine in service reoil the points mentioned in Index XII.
Directions for the operations with the tapetransmitter attachment installed:
a) The ON-button 2404/3 () of the tapetransmitter attachment must not be
depressed when the tape is inserted as otherwise false signals will be
transmitted during the start-up period of the teleprinter (about 1 sec.).
b) Do not operate the keyboard when tape transmission is in progress because
the message will be mutilated.
Circuitry
Circuit and wiring diagrams of the tapetransmitter attachment are contained
in section 7 of this Index.
For connecting the teleprinter with tapetransmitter attachment and for external
circuits consult the applicable paragraphs of Index II.
The tapetransmitter is electrically connected to the teleprinter by a blade
terminal strip. The send contact and the RF suppressor devices are installed
inside a metal container in order to guarantee RF suppression grade K (as per
VDE 0875 specifications) also within the VHF range of up to 300 mc.
Operation
Threading the perforated tape
The perforated tape 17.4±0.1 mm wide passes through the transmitter from
right to left and, after having passed the reading station, is deflected to the
front (see Fig. 1). Depress tape lid latching lever 2402/3 until tape retainer lid
2403 springs open. Insert the perforated tape in such a way that the pins of
the feed wheel properly engage the holes in the perforated tape and close
tape retainer lid (the beginning end of tapes is arrow-shaped).
If transmission is to start with a certain code combination, place the respective
row of perforations over the sensing levers.
Switching on and off the tapetransmitter attachment
Before cutting in the transmitter establish a connection with the far-end station
and switch on the tapetransmitter attachment by depressing the start button
2404/3 (). The tapetransmitter attachment is switched off either manually by
depressing the OFF-button 2405 () or automatically at the end of the tape
by the end-of-tape lever.
The receiving station can break an incoming transmission by duplexing, but the
tapetransmitter attachment can only be switched off during the stop pulse.
This ensures that a code combination is not transmitted in mutilated form.

from the upper limit of the printing area (47.6 mm from the upper margin of the
form) should be about 1.7 mm (Fig. 25).
Adjust by turning sprocket-feed platen 2656/23.
Pointer 2673/23
The tip of pointer 2673 must be level with the lower edge of the first feed hole
in the standard form paper.
Adjust by displacing pointer 2673 within the limits allowed by the oblong
hole.
Threaded plate 2674/22
The threaded plate must rest against tabulator rail 2678 (2682, 2683, 2684)/23.

OPERATION (only for 74.23 and 75.0 bauds)
Range finder (Fig. 6)
Under normal conditions pointer 525 with setting plate 526 should register with
graduation mark 60 on scale 32. The lowest mark on adjusting plate 33/4 should
be level with the mark on the receiver frame (minimum tension of armature
spring).
To adjust the receiver to certain line or circuit conditions, request the distant
station to transmit characters "R" and "Y" alternately. Loosen fillister head
screw 34/6 and, with the teleprinter in operation, move pointer 525 to the
left and right until a wrong signal is just printed. It may be necessary to
repeat this adjustment with different armature spring tensions by moving adjusting plate 33/4 from setting mark to setting mark. The adjustment of plate 33
should be selected which provides maximum receive margin.
Set pointer 525/6 to the center of the margin for both reception and monitoring,
e. g. in case of proper reception between graduation marks 40 and 90, set
the pointer to 65. This adjustment applies only to lines and circuits over which
the receiver is permanently operated. Where the teleprinter is connected to an
exchange, adjustments have to be carried out in co-operation with the exchange personnel.

1. GENERAL
Before startirg maintenance operations be sure to pull the power and telegraph
plugs from their wall outlets.
The lubrications specified below have proved eminently suitable for preventive
maintenance. If these types of lubrications are not available, use equivalent
ones:
Teleprinter oil K Isoflex oil
("PDP 61 A" of Messrs. Klüber,
Munich/Germany)
Viscosity at 20° C 99 C St
50° C 37 C St
or
Teleprinter oil pure mineral oil
(Shell "BC 8")
Viscosity at 20° C 130...140 C St
50° C 30...35 C St
Teleprinter grease
(Shell "FL 2")
Grease on a lithium soap base
Minimum drip point at 150° C
2.
3.
Shell "Retinax G" grease
(formerly called "Ambroleum")
All machines from serial No. 2 S 41500 onwards are oiled with teleprinter oil K
and not with teleprinter oil I. It may be used in place of teleprinter oil I.
To permit ready tracing of points to be lubricated they have been marked by
colored dots in Figs. 1 to 24. The color indicates the lubricants to be used.
The teleprinter and its companion units are thoroughly oiled and greased before
they leave our works.
Prior to placing the equipment in service for the first time it should be carefully
oiled in accordance with Figs. 1 to 3 (for the basic version) and 17 to 20,
22 to 24 (for companion units).
Further preventive maintenance of the teleprinter should then be regularly performed at intervals of 1000 maintenance units or after one year if the machine is
little used.
The number of maintenance units is determined by a built-in counting mechanism
which directly indicates the units.
After approximately 10,000 maintenance units the teleprinter and its companion
units should be subjected to a general overhaul.
CLEANING
Remove the dust depositing on and in the machine at adequate intervals using
a dust cloth and a dust brush. Take care that no dirt is wiped on vital components and surfaces of the machine.
Clean the teleprinter types in the same way as those of a normal office typewriter. It is recommended not to use a brush but rather one of the available
plastic type cleaners.
Use the chad remover (Fig. 21) to remove chads and paper fluff from the reperforator attachment.
ROUTINE MAINTENANCE
3.1. Remove excess oil, grease and dirt. Be careful not to wipe any dirt on to vital
components and surfaces of the machine. It will be advisable to mask such
spots for protection.
3.2. Check the commutator and the governor slip rings for sound condition. If the
surface of the commutator or slip rings is found to be contaminated, i. e. if is not
smooth or fails to show a uniformly dark metallic lustre, clean these parts with
a cloth wetted with a solvent, such as carbon tetrachloride. Be careful to wipe
in axial direction to avoíd clogging of the grooves between the segments.
XII
-4—
3.3.
Do notuse emery paper or similar materi al.
If the surface turns out to be rough or pitted touch up the commutator in a lathe.
Check the motor carbon brushes (automatic break types 25 mm long) and the
governor carbon brushes (approx. 13 mm long, inclusive of holder) at intervals
of 1000 maintenance units. If the motor carbon brushes have been worn down
to a length of about 16 mm, replace them to prevent the disconnect time from
falling in between maintenance intervals.
Replace the governor carbon brushes when they have been worn down to a
length of about 8 mm (inclusive of holder).
Clean the guides of the motor and governor carbon brushes as well as the commutator and governor carbon bridges from carbon dust and oil which may
adhere to them.
3.4. Check governor contacts and, if found excessively pitted, replace them.
3.5
3.6.
3.7.
Oil and grease the spots indicated in the Figs. 2, 4 to 14, 17 to 20 and 22
to 24.
In some cases assemblies are shown in removed condition for better visibility
of the lubricating points. However, these assemblies need not be removed for
performing routine maintenance operations.
We advise against excessive oiling
For oiling it is advisable to dip a wire of about 1 mm diam. into oil about 5 mm
deep. The droplet forming at the end of the wire is sufficient for one lubricating
point.
Whenever the machine has been oiled, clean the contacts, the armature, the
residual plate and the magnet core of the magnet assemblies. Pull a lintfree
paper strip (e. g. perforator tape) through between the contacts and between
the pole plate and the pole shoes.
Do not bend contact sprin gs.
Use teleprinter oil K or I for oiling the lubricating felts as well as the felts
disks provided in the felt clutches.
Prior to installation put new lubricating felts and felt discs on oil until they
are impregnated and begin to sink.
Use teleprinter oil K or I for oiling the friction, gliding and bearing surtaces
as well as lubricating felts not specially indicated in the Figs. 4 to 14, 17 to 20
and 22 to 24.
3.8. Use teleprinter oil K or I for lubricating the suspension points of tension springs
as well as the points of contact of pressure and torsion springs.
In our works, Shell Grease "Retinax G" has been used for these points.
3.9. If the cutting edges of the holes in the perforator tape produced by the reperforator attachment are no longer sharp, it may be assumed that the guides of
the punches have widened or that the punches are blunt. In such a case replace
the punches 2225 and 2226 by the punches 2290 and 2291 (diameter larger by
0.03 mm) or punches 2292 and 2293 (diameter larger by 0.06 mm).
3.10. When oiling the shock absorber (Fig. 4), special care should be taken that the
lubricating felt in the brake cylinder is soaked with teleprinter oil K or I.
3.11. With the commutator motor running, check the motor speed by means of a
125-cps tuning fork. Watch the stroboscopic pattern on the governor cover
through the vibrating shutter of the 125-cps tuning fork with the motor running
and the run-out key held depressed. If the speed is correct the stroboscopic
marks appear to be stationary. If the speed is too high, the stroboscopic marks
appear to wander away in the sense of the motor rotation. If it is too low
they will wander in the opposite direction.
Adjustment for correct motor speed is made by turning the screw accessible
through a bore in the periphery of the governor cover.
Speed too high: Turn setting screw counter-clockwise.
Speed too low: Turn setting screw clockwise.
4. GENERAL OVERHAUL
4.1.
-5-
Remove all mechanical and electrical components and assemblies.
With a view to saving time during general overhaul operations large maintenance shops are advised to procure a special washing device which eliminates
the need for a complete disassembly of the machine. However, electrical
components, such as magnet coils, motor etc., sleeves and all other rubber parts
as well as the ball bearings must be removed previously. Please write for
address of suppliers of washing devices and suitable cleaning agents.
4.2. Clean mechanical components with benzine with 5 per cent oil added. Check
for wear and tear and replace the parts if necessary. Oil or spray the dry
parts with teleprinter oil K or 1.
4.3. Clean contact spring sets with chemically pure gasoline.
4.4. Always apply a film of oil repellent to the parts marked by a red dot. For
more detailed information see para. 5.
4.5. Clean bail bearings with benzine and fill them with teleprinter grease up
one third of their diameter.
Note:
to
Only oil the ball bearings of the type basket carriage (with teleprinter oil
K or I).
4.6. Replace the motor ball bearings.
4.7. Replace the spherical bushing of the gliding ball bearings. Take care that the
bushing is embedded in teleprinter grease.
4.8 Grease the suspension points of tension springs as well as points of contact
of pressure and torsion springs with Shell "Retinax G" grease.
4.9 Grease the friction surfaces marked in Figs. 15 and 16 with Shell "Retinax G"
grease.
4.10. Unless heavy wear and tear justify replacement, lubricating felts should
washed with benzine, then dried and soaked with teleprinter oil K or I.
be
4.11. Assemble machine and observe the applicable adjustment instructions.
4.12. Perform routine maintenance operations as described in paras. 3.2. to 3.7. and
3.9. to 3.11.
Do not switch on the machine before overhaul has been completed.
5. APPLYING A FILM OF OIL REPELLENT
Parts the smooth operation of which is likely to be affected by the tendency
of oil to spread over surfaces, are to be treated with an oil repellent. These
parts are marked in our works with a red dot.
The oil repellent is made up of
5 per cent stearic acid and
95 per cent toluene
Caution: The solvent is highly inflammable.
Owing to its high inflammability oil repellent is not supplied by our works. It
can be obtained from appropriate shops (pharmacies, chemical dealers).
Application of a new film of oil repellent will become necessary as soon as
proper functioning of the parts, such as contacts or selector magnet, is impaired
by splash oil or by contamination or after these parts have been cleaned with
a solvent.
XII
-6—
Application
Clean the parts from oil and dust, using benzine. Do not use carbon tetrachloride.
Pour the oil repellent into a glass or porcelain container and heat it up to
30 to 40° C in a water bath.
Dip the parts into this solvent and remove excess fluid with a cloth.
Dry the parts immediately with a clean woollen cloth or in pre-heated resinfree
wooden chips (beech wood chips). Do not dry them in the air. Clean the contacts with a fuzzfree paper strip (e. g. perforator tape), pulling the tape
through between the contacts.
Refill the fluid into the bottle and shut with a tight-fitting plug.
The colorless oil repellent forms a very thin film which sticks fast to clean
metallic surfaces.
